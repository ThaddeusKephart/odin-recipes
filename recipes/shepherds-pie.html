    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There’s a reason why shepherd’s pie is a consistent family crowd-pleaser. 
        With a thick and hearty filling of ground meat, an array of nutritious 
        vegetables and a cloud-like topping of mashed potatoes and melted 
        cheese, what’s not to love? And here’s another thing to love. In this 
        recipe, the entire dish is cooked in a skillet, saving you from both 
        tedious dish cleanup and bake time.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>2 cups frozen corn, thawed</li>
        <li>2 cups frozen peas, thawed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon beef bouillon granules</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cold water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>3-1/2 cups mashed potatoes (prepared with milk and butter)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet, cook beef and onion over medium heat 
            until meat is no longer pink, breaking it into crumbles; drain. 
            Stir in the corn, peas, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce and 
            garlic. Reduce heat to medium-low; cover and cook for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine the cornstarch, bouillon and water until well blended; 
            stir into beef mixture. Bring to a boil over medium heat; cook 
            and stir until thickened, 2 minutes. Stir in sour cream and 
            heat through (do not boil).</li>
        <li>Spread mashed potatoes over the top; sprinkle with cheese. 
            Cover and cook until potatoes are heated through and cheese is 
            melted.</li>
