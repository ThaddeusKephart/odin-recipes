    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This chicken Creole recipe hits all the notes of our beloved comfort 
        foods. It's a simple, one-pot meal that's rich and warming. And you 
        can easily add more spice to taste if you like a little heat with your 
        chicken.</p>
    <p>Tender bites of chicken simmer in a luscious tomato sauce with onion, 
        celery and green bell pepper, ingredients commonly used in Cajun and 
        Creole food. The vegetables add a complex aroma, making this 30-minute 
        sauce taste like it simmered all day. Creole chicken is often served 
        over rice, but you can also spoon it over grits or your starch of choice.</p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>

            cast-iron or other heavy skillet over medium heat, brown chicken 
            in oil; remove and set aside. In the same skillet, saute onion, 
            celery, green pepper and garlic until tender. Stir in tomatoes, 
            water, paprika, remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, cayenne pepper and 
            bay leaf; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Return chicken to skillet. Whisk cornstarch and cold water until 
            smooth; stir into chicken mixture and bring to a boil. Simmer, 
            uncovered, until chicken is tender, 10-15 minutes. Remove bay 
            leaf before serving. If desired, serve with rice.</li>
