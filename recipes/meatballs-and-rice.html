    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This meatballs and rice recipe puts hot, scratch-made 
        meatballs on your table in 25 minutes flat, thanks to your 
        pressure cooker. It's just as quick as using frozen meatballs, 
        but you control what goes into them.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>1/2 cup uncooked instant rice</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef (90% lean)</li>
        <li>1 can (10-3/4 ounces) condensed tomato soup, undiluted</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li><em>Optional</em>: Hot cooked rice and chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, combine egg, rice, onion, parsley, salt and pepper. 
        Crumble beef over mixture and mix lightly but thoroughly. Shape 
        into 1-1/2-in. balls. Arrange on a trivet in a 6-qt. electric pressure 
        cooker. Combine condensed soup, water and Worcestershire sauce; 
        pour over meatballs.</li>
        <li>Lock lid; close pressure-release valve. Adjust to pressure-cook on 
        high for 10 minutes. Quick-release pressure. Let stand 5 minutes 
        before serving. If desired, serve with rice and top with chopped 
        parsley.</li>
    </ol>
