    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Imagine crispy, golden tater tots forming a delightful crust, 
        cradling a savory, seasoned ground beef filling. This Pizza Tater 
        Tot Casserole is a comforting and crowd-pleasing dish that combines 
        the best of two worlds. 1  A rich tomato sauce, studded with tender 
        onions, vibrant green peppers, and a hidden boost of spinach, melds 
        with the browned ground beef, creating a hearty base. This flavorful 
        mixture is then nestled between layers of perfectly baked tater 
        tots, their crispy exteriors providing a satisfying crunch with 
        every bite. Finally, a generous blanket of melted mozzarella cheese 
        tops it all off, adding a gooey, cheesy finish that pulls it all 
        together. This easy-to-make casserole is a guaranteed hit for 
        weeknight dinners or casual gatherings, offering a fun and delicious 
        twist on classic comfort food.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1-1/2 pounds ground beef</li>
        <li><em>Optional: </em>1 medium green pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 pound sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
