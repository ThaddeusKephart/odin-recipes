        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>If you're in the mood for comfort food that's aromatic and fall-apart tender,
             this braised beef with polenta recipe is exactly what you need. And to take a 
             break from the usual traditional mashed potatoes, the beef is served over soft, 
             cheesy polenta that you stir together once the beef is nearly done cooking. You can 
             serve beef with polenta as-is, or add a fresh green salad and some crusty French 
             bread to sop up all the sauce at the bottom of your bowl.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup minced fresh rosemary</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>3 teaspoons salt, divided</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon pepper</li>
            <li>1 boneless beef chuck roast (3 pounds)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
            <li>1 cup beef broth</li>
            <li>2 cups water</li>
            <li>2 cups 2% milk</li>
            <li>1 cup cornmeal</li>
            <li>1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter, cubed</li>
            <li><em>Optional</em>: Additional rosemary and Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix rosemary, garlic, 2 teaspoons salt and pepper; rub over meat. In a 
                large skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat; brown meat. Transfer meat 
                to a 5- or 6-qt. slow cooker. Add broth to skillet; cook 1 minute, 
                stirring to loosen browned bits from pan. Pour over meat. Cook, covered, 
                on low 7-9 hours or until meat is tender.</li>
            <li>For polenta, in a large heavy saucepan, bring water, milk and remaining 1 
                teaspoon salt to a boil. Reduce heat to a gentle boil; slowly whisk in 
                cornmeal. Cook and stir with a wooden spoon until polenta thickens and 
                pulls away cleanly from side of pan, 15-20 minutes. (Mixture will be very 
                thick.) Remove from heat; stir in Parmesan cheese and butter. Serve with 
                roast. If desired, serve with additional rosemary and shredded Parmesan cheese.</li>
